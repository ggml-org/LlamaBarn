/// `llama.app`, which also publishes a JSON endpoint the app can
/// consume. We use it for a lightweight in-app "Discover" section — a handful of
/// featured families, up to two device-appropriate picks each — so a fresh
/// install can get a model running in a couple of clicks without first visiting
/// the website.
///
/// Each featured family shows every size this Mac can run, one row per size,
/// each resolved to the highest-precision quant that fits. "Full precision" is
/// whatever the catalog lists as the size's top build — Q8 for 16-bit families,
/// Q4 for QAT ones like Gemma 3 — and lower quants are strictly fallbacks. So a
/// row's quant is never a choice we made: a below-top quant means the top one
/// wouldn't run on this machine, nothing more. Which sizes exist and which
/// families are featured is the website's curation; the app only filters by
/// what fits (plus optional per-family and per-size memory caps, also declared
/// by the catalog).
///
/// The full browsing experience stays on the web; the app only ever reads the
/// `featured` slice.
